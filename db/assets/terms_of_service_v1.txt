The simultaneous use of two or more accounts at any given time by a single person is a violation of this Agreement and is grounds for immediate termination of Service.

Personal information provided by Users is safeguarded by the Company pursuant to its **[Privacy Policy](http://tabard.com/privacy-policy)**.

**ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY**

The Company intends (but cannot guarantee) that the Service be a safe, responsible on-line community that can be enjoyed by its Users.  By creating this Acceptable Use Policy, the Company does not imply that it will have the ability to, or the responsibility to, actively police the Service in order to deter or address violations thereto.  The Company will take reasonable steps to address violations that are brought to its attention.  If you believe that another User is violating this Acceptable Use Policy, then you may report the violation at **[Violations@tabard.com](mailto:violations@tabard.com)**.

The security of the network through which the Service is provided, as well as the security of individual User Accounts, is of paramount importance.  Therefore you agree to abide by the following security rules:

1. All information you provide during the User Account registration process must be true and accurate.  When information changes, such as your adoption of a new email address, you are responsible for updating your user profile.  **THE SERVICE IS NOT AVAILABLE TO ANYONE UNDER THE AGE OF 13.**
2. Display names must not infringe on the intellectual property rights of any person or entity.  We reserve the right to deactivate your Account and require the selection of another display name if We are advised that your display name infringes on someone's intellectual property rights.
3. If We deactivate your Account you may not create another Account without our prior permission.
4. Passwords must meet security guidelines and must not be shared with others in such a way that compromises or threatens the security of your Account or that of the Service.

**BILLING FOR PRO COMMUNITY UPGRADES AND ADDITIONAL ADVANCED FEATURES OR MEMBER PACKS**

Users may sign up for an Account and create a Community for free.  Users who create a Community are considered the Administrator for the Community and are responsible for all upgrades and billing for the Community.  Free Communities do not have access to certain Advanced Features that may be offered by the Company from time to time and also have certain limitations including number of Members.

A Community's Administrator may access such Advanced Features as Company may offer from time to time, as well as add more Members to the Community, by upgrading the Community to be a Pro Community (if and when Pro Upgrades are available). Once a Community has been upgraded to a Pro Community, then the Community will automatically have access to certain Advanced Features.  From time to time Company may offer additional Advanced Features to Pro Communities (beyond those that are automatically accessible to Pro Communities simply by upgrading) which Community Administrators may choose to subscribe to as well.  Upgrading a Community to Pro will also allow the addition of Member Packs that will enable a larger number of Members to be part of the Community.  The Advanced Features that are available for Pro Communities may change from time to time at the discretion of the Company but will always be made clear to Community Administrators through the subscription functionality for Pro Community Administrators.

Billing for Pro Communities is the responsibility of the Community's Administrator and must be done through the Community Administrator's User Account using the credit card processing functionality that will accept major credit cards as indicated.  Billing may be on a recurring subscription basis or on a one-time basis depending on the upgrade, feature or functionality being purchased.  Pro Upgrades and Member Packs as they become available and offered, will always be on a recurring subscription basis.  Other Advanced Features will clearly state whether they are available on a one-time fee or recurring subscription basis.
Community Administrators who purchase a recurring subscription based Pro Upgrade, Advanced Feature or Member Pack (collectively "Subscription Service") agree, by submitting the transaction for the purchase, to authorize Company, by and through Company's third-party payment processor, to charge their credit card with the associated fee immediately, and then once every 30 days until the Community Administrator terminates the Subscription Service.  Each payment of the associated fee for the Subscription Service will constitute payment in advance for the following 30 days.  Once a Community Administrator has upgraded a Community to Pro, he/she is free to add as many additional Advanced Features or Member Packs as may be offered and are desired.  However, if the purchase of the additional Advanced Feature(s)/Member Pack(s) are not made exactly on a recurring billing date (ie every 30 days) for the initial Pro Upgrade, and before payment is processed on that day, then the subsequently purchased Subscription Service(s) will not be billed immediately.  Rather, a pro-rated fee for the subsequently purchased Subscription Service(s) will be charged, along with a full fee for 30 days charged in advance for the subsequently purchased Subscription Service and the recurring bill for the original Pro Upgrade, on the next billing date for the original Pro Upgrade.

For example: A Community Administrator has been paying $10 per 30 day period for some time for a Pro Community.  Half way through the current 30 day period they decide to add a Member Pack, which is $2 per 30 day period.  On their next statement, they will see a one-time prorated charge of $1 for the Member Pack for the previous 30 day period, as well as a $2 charge for the Member Pack for the coming 30 day period in addition to the regular $10 per 30 day period charge for the Pro Community.

**TERMINATION OF SUBSCRIPTION FOR PRO COMMUNITY, ADDITIONAL ADVANCED FEATURES OR MEMBER PACKS**

Community Administrators may terminate a subscription for any Subscription Services at any time by utilizing the functionality for doing so through their User Account.  If a Community Administrator does so, no pro-rated refunds will be due or owing.  Instead, the Subscription Services that are terminated will be available for the rest of the then-current billing cycle, after which no further charges will be made to the User's credit card, and access to the Subscription Services will end.

If a Community Administrator terminates a subscription for a Subscription Service then decides to reactivate the subscription during the same billing cycle, the billing for that Subscription Service will continue as if no cancelation had been initiated.  However, if a Community Administrator terminates a subscription for a Subscription Service and then reactivates it and adds additional Subscription Service at the same time during the same billing cycle, the billing for the additional Subscription Service will be added to the billing on the next billing date including any pro-rated billing necessary.
Pro upgrades, any additional advanced features and Member Packs are specific to the Community for which they were purchased and may not be transferred from one Community to another even within the same User Account.

**CHARGEBACK FEE**

In the event that, at any time after any credit card transaction you initiate (including recurring payments for subscriptions) is accepted, the particular credit card transaction is dishonored for any reason other than by reason of an error by Us and We incur a chargeback to our merchant account, then you agree to pay a Chargeback Fee of $50 and further expressly authorize Us to charge such a fee to your credit card.  If We are unable to initially charge the Chargeback Fee to your credit card due to the fact that it is invalid or otherwise declined, then the Chargeback Fee will remain as a debit on your User Account and you will not be able to make any further credit card purchase transactions through your User Account until the Chargeback Fee is paid in full.  Chargeback Fees do not apply to any situation where your credit card, presented for payment in any transaction, is simply declined and therefore no charge is ever made on your credit card.
