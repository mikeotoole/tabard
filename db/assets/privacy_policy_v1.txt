**What We Never Do with Information We Collect or Receive**

We never sell or lend personal information We collect from or about you to any third-party for commercial purposes.  For purposes of this statement, We define "personal information" as information We possess from or about you, that can be readily correlated with you as an individual person.  For example, your address, your individual user habits, or your credit card information, would all constitute personal information.  In contrast, a geographical count of users residing in a certain geographical area (without providing names), aggregate data about how many users have certain user habits, and how many users purchased a certain service using credit cards, would not be personally identifiable with you individually, and therefore would not constitute personal information.

In the case of credit card information necessary for a purchase transaction, We utilize a payment processor gateway that collects all of your information directly onto their secure servers.  None of Our servers or resources keep any of your credit card information at any time.

**How We Use Information We Collect or Receive**

*Personal Information*  
Your email address, date of birth (unless you choose to publicly share it), phone number or other contact information, and your real name (unless you choose to publicly share it) are considered Personal Information.  We do not make your Personal Information publicly visible or available, do not allow other Users to access this information, and do not place this information in any portion of the Services that are available to be crawled or indexed by search engines.

We may contact you via your email address, phone number, or other provided contact information, for customer service or administrative matters.  We will only use your email address for commercial solicitation in the manner described below under the **Commercial Solicitations** section.

We are constantly striving to improve the user experience with the Service, and to enhance the safety and security of users, the Service, and the network resources on which the Service resides.  We may use your Personal Information to assist Us in making these user experience and safety/security improvements.  We may also use your Personal Information as necessary if We need to address or investigate a complaint about violations of the Acceptable Use Policy.

In the course of designing improvements, enhancements or value added products for the Service, We may access or utilize your personal information.  From time to time this may include needing to contract with other professionals, including, but not limited to programmers, security professionals, game designers, and networking professionals (collectively "Enterprise Partners") who may be contracted to assist with such product development functions.  Such Enterprise Partners may, in the course of product development, need access to your personal information.  However, We always ensure that such Enterprise Partners are not only reputable, but are also contractually bound to follow these same privacy polices.

*Public Information*  
All information or data that is not Personal Information (as defined above) is considered Public Information.  This includes data and information you voluntarily place in your User Profile, in messages or postings intended to be public (such as comments in open forums or contributions to Wiki pages), pages you create and the contents thereto, are considered Public Information and are made public to all Users and may be indexed by and visible via commonly used internet search engines such as Google or Yahoo. We do not manage, moderate or delete Public Information unless they violate Copyright Law, Trademark Law, or violate Our Acceptable Use Policy.  If you decide to cancel your account, while your User Profile will be deactivated and archived and therefore no longer accessible to other users and the public, it will not be deleted.  Furthermore, cached versions of your User Profile may be available throughout the internet from sources other than servers or networks We operate or use.

**Commercial Solicitations**

We respect your commercial solicitation preferences (and the provisions of the Can SPAM Act) and will never send unwanted commercial solicitations to you either by messaging functionality built in to the Service, by email, social media messaging or posting, or any other means.

We will only send you commercial solicitations if you have opted in to receive such solicitations.

If you decide to unsubscribe from commercial solicitations, We will remove you from our commercial solicitation list promptly and will not send any further commercial solicitations.

For purposes of the Can SPAM Act, our physical address is:

> DigitalAugment Inc.  
> 202 N 3rd Ave  
> Pasco, WA 99301

Please contact Us immediately by email at **[Spam@Crumblin.com](mailto:spam@crumblin.com)** if you believe that you have either received unwanted commercial solicitations or if you have tried, and have been unable to unsubscribe from commercial solicitations.

**Aggregate Data**

We reserve the right to use Aggregate Data for any legitimate business purpose including business functions that involve sharing such data with other companies, individuals, or organizations.  This may include, but is not limited to, promoting the Service to game platforms, improving security, enhancing the user experience, planning for expansion of service resources, or for enforcement of the Acceptable Use Policy.  For purposes of this section, Aggregate Data is defined as an aggregate compilation of data in an overall, statistical report, detailing actions, characteristics, demographics, or other useful information over a given period of time when the compilation makes no references to individual users and cannot reasonably, even by correlating with other data sources, be used to identify individual users or track their habits.

**Cancellation of your Account**

If you decide to cancel your account with the Service, We will continue to abide by this Privacy Policy.  However, since individual user data is almost always heavily ingrained with the framework of the Service as well as the user communities that are based on the Service, none of your personal information will be actually deleted.  Instead, your Personal Information will be archived and your personal account and User Profile will be deactivated.  Once your Personal Information is archived and your personal account and User Profile is deactivated, other users will not be able to access any of your Personal Information but it will remain accessible to Us and our Enterprise Partners.  Please note, however, that even after your User Profile is archived, cached versions of it may still be available throughout the internet from sources other than servers or networks that We operate or use.  Public Information will continue to be available to the public even after you cancel your account. 

**Reports of Privacy Concerns**

We take your privacy concerns very seriously.  If you have questions about the policy or a concern about your privacy, or the application of this Privacy Policy, please contact **[Privacy@Crumblin.com](mailto:privacy@crumblin.com)** and We will address your concern immediately.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

From time to time We may need to change this Privacy Policy.  If this Privacy Policy is changed, then a copy will be immediately posted on the main website for the Service as well as other applicable Websites operated by the Company, and you will also be prompted about the change and presented with a copy of the changed Privacy Policy the next time you log in to your account or access any resources associated with the Service.  Thereupon, you will need to agree to the new Privacy Policy in order to access any resources associated with the Service.  If you choose not to accept the new Privacy Policy, then you will no longer be able to use the Service.
